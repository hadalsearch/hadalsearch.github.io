        <b>The Problem</b> 
        <br>
        Search quality has notably decreased in recent years. We think we can improve your search  experience with a handful of minor changes:  
        <br>

        <b>Our Solution</b>
        <br><br>
        1) <b>Privacy</b>
        <br>
        We will only collect the minimum data required to make sure you have the best search experience possible, and we promise to never sell your data.  
        <br><br>

        2) <b>Search Filters</b>
        <br>
        
        Sometimes you just don't  want to see certain kinds of websites. Because of this we have created filters so that you can remove a handful of categories of sites from your results. <br>
        <br>
