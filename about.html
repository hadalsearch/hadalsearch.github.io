        <b>About Us</b>
        <br><br>
        
        <b>The Problem</b> 
        <br>
        Search quality has notably decreased in recent years. We believe this decline can be attributed to a few major factors: 
        <br>
        1) Excess clutter (ads, or anything that gets in the way of you seeing the first real result)
        <br>
        2) Low quality sites gaming the system with "SEO" practices. (e.g. recipe pages that have low quality novels written before you can see the actual recipe)
        <br>
        3) A misunderstanding of the individual user and what they want from search
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Our Solution</b>
        <br><br>
        0) <b>Privacy</b>
        <br>
        Our "0th Law" is that we will do everything we can to protect your privacy. 
        We will only collect the minimum data required to make sure you have the best search experience possible, and we promise to never sell your data.  
        <br><br>

        1) <b>Ad Free Subscription</b>
        <br>
        By charging a subscription fee, we can avoid having ads on our website, which will allow us to greatly reduce clutter from our results page. <br>
        
        This also properly aligns our interests to that of the user. Since most of our revenue  is derived from subscriptions, our revenue is dependent on you having a great search experience, not clicking the most ads.  
        <br><br>
        
        2) <b>Search Filters</b>
        <br>
        
        In our own search experience we have found that sometimes we  don't want to see any website of <i>X</i> category. For example, if we are looking for the original source of something that has recently hit the news, we don't want any of the news articles about it. Instead of sifting through hundreds of irrelevant news articles, in this situation we would like to remove the news results altogether. 
        <br>
        Because of this realization, we have created (and are constantly updating) a number of standard filters so that you can remove certain categories of web pages that you know won't be relevant for this search. At this time we have 2 filters: Default and No-News. Default does not filter out any results, and No-News removes most of the most popular news sources, so you can dig deeper into a topic more quickly and skip the countless shallow news articles that inevitably rise to the top of other search engines. 
        <br><br>

        3) <b>Individual Customization</b>
        <br>
        Finally, we believe that you want a search engine that caters specifically to you. There isn't a one-size-fits-all search algorithm. For the same search, we all want different types of results ranging from: breaking news sites to blog posts, and summaries to in depth academic papers. There  isn't one search algorithm that can cater to all of us, and large search companies trying to build one has ensured that it doesn't optimally cater to any of us. 
        <br>
        Our first step in solving this problem is allowing users to create their own customized filters, removing sites that you feel are irrelevant to you. This is the first step to make search results specific to the individual, and we hope you stick with us on our quest to create the best search  experience possible for every single one of us.

        <b>The Team</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Founder: Evans Hedges<br>
        Evans is currently a Mathematics PhD student at the University of Denver. Evans began working on what would turn into HADAL in the summer of 2020 when he became frustrated enough with his inability to find quality introductory material on Quantum Computing anywhere on the internet.  Refusing to believe that there isn't a single web page with rigerous introductory material to this topic, the only other conclusion was that current search  engines were doing a poor job showing him the results that he wanted. Combined with a concern for privacy on the web and a strong aversion to adversements, Evans started out on a mission to create the best possible search experience.
